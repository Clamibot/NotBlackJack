# **Description:**

NotBlackJack - A Third Person Shooter Game By Matthew Wethington, Chris Hahn, Zachary Bankhead, And Toan Dao.

This Is Our Semester Project For CS 4361 (Computer Graphics) For The Spring of 2020 Semester.

# **Gameplay:**

In this game, the player controls a third person character. There isn't really a storyline, and the game mostly focuses on combat. The player's goal is to complete all 4 levels of the game by getting through all the levels without dying. These 4 levels include in this order: building hopping, a path to the casino, the casino level with a fully destructible casino building, and more building hopping.

This game showcases everything we've learned about game design up to the point this game was made. This game also showcases my first foray into destructible environments, as the casino level (level 3) features a fully destructible casino building.

# **Weapons:**

The Player Can Switch Between 4 Weapons: Pistol, Assault Rifle, Sniper Rifle, And Death Ray.

## **Pistol:**

The pistol is a semi-automatic weapon that can fire as fast as you can pull the trigger. This weapon has the least range, but is good for close quarters combat.

## **Assault Rifle:**

The assault rifle is a fully automatic weapon that does well at close to medium range.

## **Sniper Rifle:**

The sniper rifle is a powerful weapon that deals high damage, but has the lowest fire rate. This weapon is best for medium to long range.

## **Death Ray:**

The death ray is the most powerful weapon in the game. It deals the highest amount of damage and is effective at any range, but the ammunition you get at the beginning of the game is the only ammunition you get for the entire game. Once the battery is depleted, that's it.
